Hi there! 👋 I'm **Prince Oforh Asiedu**, a passionate software engineer and open-source security advocate based in Africa. I'm currently focused on developing robust, scalable solutions using Django, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Docker, Redis, and more. I’m deeply interested in cybersecurity and cloud-native technologies, aiming to contribute to impactful projects in these fields.

I’m building Phelsy, a Django-Postgresql based e-commerce platform, and enjoy collaborating on open-source projects, particularly around Python and security.

When I’m not coding, I’m studying, contributing to initiatives like OpenSSF, and expanding my skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing. Feel free to connect with me or open an issue if you’d like to collaborate!

💻 Learning: Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, and Ethical Hacking.
🌍 Open-Source Contributor: Actively contributing to various projects focused on improving security and scalability.

Let's build something amazing together!
