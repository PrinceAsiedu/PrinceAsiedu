- 👋 Hi, I’m @PrinceAsiedu
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud Development, Cyber Security, and Web Development.
- 🌱 I think I might be 🤔 working on distributed microservices with AWS, Python(Django), Linux, Kubernetes, Docker and NATs.
- 💞️ During my free time I work on my not-so-personal projects with Django and TailwindCSS.
- 🤗 And Oh! I love Flowbite[https://www.flowbite.com]! You should check them out.
